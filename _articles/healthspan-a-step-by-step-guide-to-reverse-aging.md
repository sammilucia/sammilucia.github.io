## Where to start

There's a lot of information on this topic, especially if you're just getting into healthspan, reversing aging, longevity, or simply looking after yourself as best you can. So I'll cut to the chase. This page is here to cut through the the crap.

At a glance this article will:
1. Be updated from time to time with the latest research and thinking
2. Explain thinking and have citations of well constructed studies
3. Attempt to make the information as _usable_ as possible
4. Address physical signs of aging (your appearance) as well as healthspan (reasoning is below)
5. Be budget concious where possible

If you haven't started, this article will help you start. If you're looking for the next steps, the article will help you check your priorities and achieve advanced levels of anti-aging.

Please feel free to give feedback or ask questions. This article is improved based on reader feedback, as well as my own ongoing research and discussions with medical professionals.
